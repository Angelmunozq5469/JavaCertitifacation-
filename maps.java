/*
 * Java provides several different implementations of the Map interface, each with its own characteristics and performance trade-offs. Here are some of the most commonly used implementations:

HashMap: This is the most commonly used implementation of the Map interface. 
It provides constant-time performance for the basic operations (put and get) and is very 
efficient for large datasets. 
However, it does not maintain any order for its elements.
TreeMap: This implementation maintains the elements in sorted order based 
on the natural order of their keys (or a custom comparator, if provided).
 However, its performance is slower than that of the HashMap for most operations.

 LinkedHashMap: This implementation maintains a predictable iteration 
 order based on the order in which the elements were added to the map. 
 It also provides constant-time performance for the basic operations, 
 although its performance is slightly slower than that of the HashMap.
