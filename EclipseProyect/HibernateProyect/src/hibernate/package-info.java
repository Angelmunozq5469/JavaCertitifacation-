//Que es Sprint 5?


//Spring is an open-source application framework that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. It was developed by Rod Johnson and released in 2003. The framework is designed to simplify the development of enterprise-level Java applications by promoting a modular and flexible architecture.

//Mas acerca de Spring Key Features and Concepts of the Spring Framework:

//Dependency Injection (DI): One of the core features of Spring is its implementation of the Dependency Injection (DI) pattern. DI allows objects to be loosely coupled by providing their dependencies (i.e., other objects they depend on) from an external source. This promotes easier testing, maintainability, and scalability of the application.
//Inversion of Control (IoC): IoC is a concept closely related to DI. In traditional programming, the application controls the flow of control and manages the instantiation of objects. In Spring, this control is inverted, and the framework manages the lifecycle and dependencies of objects, reducing the boilerplate code.
//Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP): Spring supports AOP, which enables developers to separate cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security, transactions) from the business logic. AOP allows these concerns to be applied to multiple parts of the application without repeating code.
//Spring Modules: The Spring Framework is organized into various modules, each providing specific functionalities. Some of the core modules include:
//Spring Core Container: Provides DI and IoC features.
//Spring Data Access/Integration: Supports database access and integration with various data sources.
//Spring Web: Supports web development, including MVC framework and RESTful web services.
//Spring Security: Provides security features and integration with authentication and authorization mechanisms.
//Spring AOP: Supports Aspect-Oriented Programming.
//Spring Test: Provides testing support for Spring applications.
//Spring Boot: Spring Boot, while not part of the core Spring Framework, is a complementary project that makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It simplifies the configuration and setup process, reducing the amount of boilerplate code required.
//Spring Data: Spring Data is a subproject of the Spring Framework that simplifies data access by providing a unified API to work with different data sources, such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, and more.
//Integration with Java EE: Spring can be easily integrated with Java EE (now Jakarta EE) technologies, such as Java Persistence API (JPA) and Java Messaging Service (JMS), allowing developers to leverage existing Java EE components in Spring applications.
