public class Sets {

/*
 * In Java, the Set interface is a collection that does not allow duplicate elements. The Set interface is part of the Java Collections Framework and provides several implementations, including HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet.

Here are the main characteristics of each of these Set implementations:

HashSet - This implementation is backed by a hash table and does not guarantee the order of elements. HashSet provides constant-time performance for the basic operations (add, remove, contains and size).
TreeSet - This implementation is backed by a TreeMap and guarantees that the elements will 
be sorted in ascending order. TreeSet provides logarithmic-time performance for most operations.
LinkedHashSet - This implementation is similar to HashSet but maintains a doubly-linked list 
that runs through all of its entries. LinkedHashSet provides constant-time performance for 
the basic operations (add, remove, contains, and size), while also maintaining the order of insertion.
